# Personal Resume Site

## Goals

- Accept Crypto Payments
  - Allow users to easily pay me crypto without requiring me to manually send a new address each time
  - Provide clean payment interface so many businesses could copy it
  - Accept payments in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) since fees are less than a cent and confirm instantly
- Link to LinkedIn, Github, Personal Projects, etc
